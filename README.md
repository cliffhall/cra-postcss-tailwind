# Starter for Tailwind with PostCSS and Create React App

A smoother way of using Tailwind CSS with Create React App. [Article here](https://dev.to/ryandunn/how-to-use-tailwind-with-create-react-app-and-postcss-with-no-hassle-2i09).

- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
  Automatically add vendor prefixes to compiled CSS, always generally a good idea to use.
- [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested)
  Use SASS style nested CSS rules.
- [Craco (Create-React-App-Configuration-Override)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco)
  Allow us to use PostCSS to compile tailwind and the other plugins with webpack without the need for ejecting.
